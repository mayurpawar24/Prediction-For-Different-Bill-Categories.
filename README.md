kindly check Assessment test for data science solution file along with data set.

Implementation of code along with dataset to  
1. Predict the label for the bills with blank categories
2. Predict the label for the new set of bills which will be added in future


Problem Statement : 
Atlantis motor works is a large manufacturing firm engaged in making cars that 
use biologically derived carbon-hydrogen molecules to power the mobility of 
today. As a large multinational corporation, the financial team of Atlantis 
validates and checks thousands of bills and classifies them to the different bill 
categories according to the below information of the bill:
1. Company Name 
2. Financial Department 
3. Financial Account Group 
4. Vendor Name 
5. The Bill amount for the past 4 months. 
The Bills data with the required attributes is provided and the Categories are 
provided for some bills in the last column, for some bills, Category is blank. This 
will form the required data set for this use case. Please refer to the “DataSet for 
the Data Science Test.xlsx” file for the same. 
As a Data Scientist need to provide the solution approach using ML/Data Science 
techniques to provide the below output 
1. Predict the label for the bills with blank categories.
2. Predict the label for the new set of bills which will be added in future.

Solution Approach :

The problem at hand can be solved using supervised machine learning 
techniques. Since the data contains labelled examples, we can train a 
classification model to predict the category of a bill based on its attributes. We 
can then use this model to predict the category of the bills with blank categories 
and also for new bills that will be added in the future.
The following are the steps that explains the solution approach :
1. Data pre-processing :
The first step is to pre-process the data by cleaning it, removing any 
unnecessary columns and transforming the categorical variables into 
numerical variables. This can be done using techniques such as one-hot 
encoding or label encoding.
2. Splitting the data :
Next, we need to split the data into a training set and a test set. The training 
set will be used to train the classification model and the test set will be used 
to evaluate its performance.
3. Feature Selection:
We need to identify which attributes are most important in predicting the 
category of a bill. We can use feature selection techniques such as correlation 
analysis or information gain to identify the most important features.
4. Choosing a classification algorithm :
We need to choose a suitable classification algorithm based on the 
characteristics of the data and the performance of the algorithm on the training 
set. Some popular classification algorithms are:
 Logistic Regression
 Decision Trees
 Random Forests
 Support Vector Machines
 Naive Bayes
5. Training the model :
After selecting the classification algorithm, we can train the model using the 
training set.
6. Evaluating the model : 
We need to evaluate the performance of the model on the test set to ensure 
that it is not overfitting or underfitting. We can use metrics such as accuracy, 
precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of the model.
7. Hyperparameter tuning :
We can further improve the performance of the model by tuning its hyper 
parameters. This can be done using techniques such as grid search or random 
search.
8. Predicting categories for new bills :
Once the model has been trained and evaluated, we can use it to predict the 
categories for the bills with blank categories and for new bills that will be 
added in the future.
 List of ML Algorithms:
 Logistic Regression
 Decision Trees
 Random Forests
 Support Vector Machines
 Naive Bayes
 Gradient Boosting
 Neural Networks
 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
 Lasso and Ridge Regression.
Note : The choice of algorithm will depend on the characteristics of the data and 
the problem at hand. We may need to try multiple algorithms and compare their 
performance before selecting the final algorithm.

Model Used To Predict The Label For Categories:
Random Forest Classifier is a popular machine learning algorithm used for 
both classification and regression tasks. Here are some reasons why Random 
Forest Classifier is commonly used:
1. High Accuracy : Random Forest Classifier is known for its high accuracy 
and ability to handle large and complex datasets. It is an ensemble method 
that combines the results of multiple decision trees, which can reduce 
overfitting and increase the model's generalization performance.
2. Robustness to outliers and missing values : Random Forest Classifier 
can handle outliers and missing values in the input features. It does not 
require data normalization or standardization and can handle both 
categorical and continuous variables.
3. Feature Importance : Random Forest Classifier can provide feature 
importance measures, which can help in feature selection and identifying 
the most important variables for the classification task.
4. Reducing bias and variance : Random Forest Classifier can reduce the 
bias and variance of individual decision trees by randomly selecting 
subsets of features and samples to train each tree. This can help prevent 
overfitting and improve the model's accuracy and generalization 
performance.
Overall, Random Forest Classifier is a powerful and versatile machine 
learning algorithm that can be used for a wide range of classification tasks. Its 
ability to handle complex datasets, outliers, missing values, and provide feature 
importance measures make it a popular choice for many data scientists and 
machine learning practitioners
